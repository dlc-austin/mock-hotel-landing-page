                <p class="question">What inspired "The Sakura Hotel" theme?</p>
                <p class="answer">I appreciate Japan's culture a lot. I never been, but it's on my bucket list to explore. 
                    I love everything about Japan, from the landscape, to anime, and finally food. 
                    Cherry blossoms are such beautiful trees with pink vibrant colors. 
                    I think it would be a luxury if a hotel would be built with cherry blossoms surrounding it.</p>
                <p class="question">What was your thought process behind the color palette for the website?</p>
                <p class="answer">I decided to choose link pink, yellow, and green to symbolize the appearance of the cherry blossom.
                    I also decided to choose blue to symbolize the clear blue sky in Japan.</p>
                <p class="question">What kind of events would you provide at the hotel?</p>
                <p class="answer">I'm a big fan of Japanese culture. These are some ideas that I have in mind:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning Basic Japanese Words</li>
                        <li>Learning how to make sushi</li>
                        <li>Learning how to make ramen/noodles</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="question">What kind of amenities would you provide at the hotel?</p>
                <p class="answer">I want to put an outdoor rock climbing wall and golf course. Physical activities while being surrounded by a scenery environment with family and friends sound like a great time.</p>
